TITLE: CARBON FOOTPRINT CALCULATOR 
Concept of the Project: 
The Carbon Footprint Calculator is an interactive web application aimed at helping individuals and 
organizations measure, understand, and reduce their carbon emissions. The tool provides users with 
a personalized analysis of their carbon footprint based on their daily activities, such as energy 
consumption, transportation, and waste generation. By offering actionable insights and 
Recommendations, the project encourages sustainable practices and supports global efforts to 
combat climate change. The platform features a user-friendly interface, detailed emission tracking, 
and personalized tips for reducing carbon impact. Key functionalities include Carbon Footprint 
Calculation, Emission Sources Analysis, Recommendations and Tips, Historical Data Tracking, and 
more. 
Problem Statement: 
Many individuals and organizations are unaware of their carbon footprint or lack an accessible tool 
to measure and manage their emissions. The absence of user-friendly, accurate, and actionable tools 
hinders efforts to reduce carbon footprints and contribute to global sustainability goals. The Carbon 
Footprint Calculator addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive, easy-to-use platform for 
Understanding and reducing carbon emissions.
